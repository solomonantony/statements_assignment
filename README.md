# statements_assignment
There are five coding questions in this assignment. Develop you code using only Google colab.

The first 3 questions are worth 10 points each, the fourth question is worth 20 points and the last question is worth 10 points. For each answer, you will record an explanation as to what each line of code does.
## 1. Travel time
Write a program that:
prompts for two inputs: distance in miles, and speed in miles per hour
calculates the time the route should take (in hours), and
displays the resulting time in hours
Display the resulting time in minutes, rounding the result to two decimals.
DO NOT USE Generative AI or anyone else's help in completing this assignment.
Record an explanation as to what each line of code does The explanation must be similar to the explanation in given in the Reading Exercise 1. Do not just read the script.

## 2. Code improvement
Consider the script shown below
`
def get_password():
  print('Hello, Joe. What is the password? (It is a fish.)')
  return input()
print('Who are you?')
name = input()
if name == 'Joe':
  while True:
      if get_password() == 'swordfish':
        print('Access granted.')
        break
`
How will you change the above script so that the loop runs only for three attempts? Assume you must use while for looping. Write your explanation and then the script.
