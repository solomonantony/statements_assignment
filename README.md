# statements_assignment
There are five coding questions in this assignment. Develop you code using only Google colab.

The first 3 questions are worth 10 points each, the fourth question is worth 20 points and the last question is worth 10 points. For each answer, you will record an explanation as to what each line of code does.
## 1. Travel time
Write a program that:
prompts for two inputs: distance in miles, and speed in miles per hour
calculates the time the route should take (in hours), and
displays the resulting time in hours
Display the resulting time in minutes, rounding the result to two decimals.
DO NOT USE Generative AI or anyone else's help in completing this assignment.
Record an explanation as to what each line of code does The explanation must be similar to the explanation in given in the Reading Exercise 1. Do not just read the script.

## 2. Code improvement
Consider the script shown below

How will you change the above script so that the loop runs only for three attempts? Assume you must use while for looping. Write your explanation and then the script.

## 3. Decision tree
Consider this decision tree.

a. Create a Python script that gets inputs from the user and implements the eligibility logic.
b. There are many ways of implementing the nested if statements. What strategy would you use to make the code more efficient?

##4. Compute average
Generate 10 integers from the range 0 to 99. Compute the average using a loop, the addition operator and the division operator. Do not use a list or other data structures or statistical functions. What value would you expect to see as the average? Why do you expect to see that average? What value did you actually see?
